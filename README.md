# Abstract
This project has no pretention, it is meant to be a way for creative individual to express their artistic and technical creativity in one ecosystem. The design philosophy of hedron is focused on creating modular features with an accent on creative elegance.

In my case, it will be used to create Lightthorned. Lightthorned is all about constructing an interesting 3d world full of life and events, where each bits (literally) represent a part of me and my journey. This a framework for me to fully express my creative energy. Lightthorned is meant to be a creative experiment rather than a game. The player is not main character and the underlying mechanics of this world are not designed to be discovered. More absstracly, it is a metaphor of life and how a single entity consume it's surrounding environment through its perception. See this ecosystem as a museum; where each part of the mind can be excited at the same tim.
